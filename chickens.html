    <h1>Chickens</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken'><b>chicken</b></a> (<i>Gallus gallus domesticus</i>), a
        subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of
        domesticated fowl, originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and
        younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. The adult female bird is
        called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.</p>
    <p>Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
        Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BCE).[1][2] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food
        (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

    <h3>Behavior</h3>
    <h4>social behavior</h4>
    <p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of
        eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "pecking order",
        with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from
        a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding
        hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[30] When a rooster finds
        food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up
        and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage
        them to eat.</p>
